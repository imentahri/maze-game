# maze-game with BFS pathfinding
This Python project creates a random maze using a graph structure and visualizes it using Turtle Graphics. The maze consists of interconnected nodes, with random walls placed between them. The Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm is implemented to find the shortest path between a start and end point in the maze.
Usage:
Run the script to generate and visualize a 10x10 random maze.
The shortest path between the top-left and bottom-right corners will be displayed.
